# Implementation Plan: Financial Account Management System

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a financial account management system that allows users to create and manage multiple financial accounts. Each account can have associated transaction files that are uploaded from financial institutions (banks, credit cards, etc.). The system will provide a comprehensive UI and backend services for managing accounts and their associated transaction files.

## Phase 1: Data Model and Infrastructure

### Step 1: Define Data Model
**Objective**: Design the data structure for financial accounts and transaction files.

**Implementation**:
1. Define Account model with fields:
   - accountId (unique identifier)
   - userId (owner of the account)
   - accountName (display name)
   - accountType (checking, savings, credit card, investment, etc.)
   - institution (bank or financial institution name)
   - balance (current balance)
   - currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
   - lastUpdated (timestamp)
   - createdAt (timestamp)
   - notes (additional information)
   - isActive (boolean)

2. Define TransactionFile model with fields:
   - fileId (unique identifier)
   - accountId (associated account)
   - userId (owner of the file)
   - fileName (original filename)
   - uploadDate (timestamp)
   - fileSize (in bytes)
   - fileFormat (CSV, OFX, QFX, etc.)
   - s3Key (location in S3 bucket)
   - processingStatus (pending, processed, error)
   - recordCount (number of transactions)
   - dateRange (start and end dates for transactions)

**Testing**:
- Validate data model with sample data
- Verify relationships between accounts and files
- Test integrity constraints and validation rules

### Step 2: Set Up Database Tables
**Objective**: Create DynamoDB tables to store account and transaction file metadata.

**Implementation**:
1. Create Accounts table:
   - Partition key: accountId
   - Sort key: none
   - Global Secondary Index: userId-createdAt for efficient retrieval
   
2. Update existing file metadata table to be TransactionFiles table:
   - Partition key: fileId
   - Sort key: none
   - Global Secondary Indexes:
     - userId-uploadDate for listing all user files
     - accountId-uploadDate for listing files by account

3. Configure auto-scaling, TTL settings, and backup policies

**Testing**:
- Verify table creation and index configuration
- Test basic CRUD operations
- Validate GSI query performance
- Test with expected data volumes

### Step 3: Update S3 Storage Structure
**Objective**: Configure S3 storage for transaction files with appropriate organization.

**Implementation**:
1. Create or update S3 bucket for transaction file storage
2. Define folder structure: `{userId}/{accountId}/{fileId}/{fileName}`
3. Configure appropriate lifecycle policies
4. Update IAM permissions for secure access
5. Ensure server-side encryption is enabled

**Testing**:
- Test file upload and retrieval
- Verify folder structure is maintained
- Validate access control and permissions
- Test encryption and data protection

### Step 4: Create Lambda Functions for Account Management
**Objective**: Implement backend services for account operations.

**Implementation**:
1. Create Lambda functions for account operations:
   - CreateAccount
   - GetAccount
   - UpdateAccount
   - DeleteAccount
   - ListAccounts
   
2. Implement validation, error handling, and logging
3. Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks
4. Add support for concurrency and conflict resolution

**Testing**:
- Unit test each Lambda function
- Test with valid and invalid input
- Verify error handling
- Test authentication and authorization
- Perform integration tests with DynamoDB

## Phase 2: API Integration

### Step 5: Create API Gateway Endpoints for Accounts
**Objective**: Expose account management services through RESTful API.

**Implementation**:
1. Create API routes for account management:
   - POST /accounts (create)
   - GET /accounts (list all)
   - GET /accounts/{id} (get one)
   - PUT /accounts/{id} (update)
   - DELETE /accounts/{id} (delete)

2. Configure authentication with Cognito
3. Set up appropriate request/response mappings
4. Implement CORS headers for browser access
5. Create API documentation

**Testing**:
- Test each endpoint with valid/invalid requests
- Verify authentication works correctly
- Test CORS for browser compatibility
- Validate API response formats
- Test error handling and status codes

### Step 6: Update File Management API
**Objective**: Extend existing file API to support transaction files associated with accounts.

**Implementation**:
1. Update or create file management endpoints:
   - POST /accounts/{id}/files (upload)
   - GET /accounts/{id}/files (list by account)
   - GET /accounts/{id}/files/{fileId} (download)
   - DELETE /accounts/{id}/files/{fileId} (delete)
   
2. Add file metadata support for transaction files
3. Implement pre-signed URL generation for secure uploads/downloads
4. Update authorization logic to check account ownership

**Testing**:
- Test file upload/download with various formats
- Verify account association is maintained
- Test authorization for account-specific operations
- Validate metadata handling

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

### Step 7: Create Account Management UI
**Objective**: Build user interface components for account management.

**Implementation**:
1. Create account dashboard component:
   - Summary of all accounts
   - Total balance across accounts
   - Quick actions for common operations
   
2. Implement account list component:
   - Sortable/filterable list of accounts
   - Account type icons and visual indicators
   - Basic account details preview
   - Action buttons (edit, delete, view files)
   
3. Build account detail component:
   - Display account information
   - Edit capability
   - Transaction file management
   - Balance history (if implemented)

4. Create account creation/edit form:
