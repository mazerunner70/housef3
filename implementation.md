## Deletion API Functions

### 1. Delete File Transactions
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/files/{file_id}/transactions`
- **Purpose**: Delete all transactions associated with a specific file
- **Implementation**:
  - Query DynamoDB for all transactions with matching `file_id`
  - Delete each transaction record
  - Return success response with count of deleted transactions

### 2. Delete Account Files
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/accounts/{id}/files`
- **Purpose**: Delete all files and their associated transactions for a specific account
- **Implementation**:
  - Query DynamoDB for all files with matching `account_id`
  - For each file:
    - Delete all associated transactions using the file transactions endpoint
    - Delete the file record
  - Return success response with counts of deleted files and transactions

### 3. Delete User Accounts
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/accounts`
- **Purpose**: Delete all accounts, their files, and associated transactions for a user
- **Implementation**:
  - Query DynamoDB for all accounts belonging to the authenticated user
  - For each account:
    - Delete all files and transactions using the account files endpoint
    - Delete the account record
  - Return success response with counts of deleted accounts, files, and transactions

### Implementation Notes
- All deletion operations should be performed in a specific order to maintain referential integrity:
  1. Delete transactions first
  2. Delete files second
  3. Delete accounts last
- Each deletion operation should be atomic and include proper error handling
- Consider implementing batch operations for better performance with large datasets
- Add appropriate logging for audit purposes
- Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only delete their own data
