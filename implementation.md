# Implementation Plan: File Management System

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to extend the current application with a file management system that allows users to upload text files to an S3 bucket, store metadata in DynamoDB, and provide a UI for listing, editing, and deleting files.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

### Step 1: Create S3 Storage Bucket
**Objective**: Set up an S3 bucket for file storage with appropriate configurations.

**Implementation**:
1. Create a new S3 bucket for file storage through Terraform
2. Configure CORS settings to allow browser uploads
3. Set up lifecycle policies for cost management
4. Update IAM permissions for file operations
5. Enable server-side encryption for security

**Testing**:
- Verify bucket creation and configuration using AWS CLI
- Test CORS settings with preflight requests
- Validate IAM permissions by attempting basic operations
- Confirm encryption is working by examining object metadata

### Step 2: Set Up DynamoDB Table
**Objective**: Create a DynamoDB table to store file metadata.

**Implementation**:
1. Define table schema with fields: 
   - fileId (partition key)
   - fileName
   - uploadDate
   - userId
   - fileSize
   - contentType
   - lastModified
2. Set up global secondary indexes for querying by userId and uploadDate
3. Configure auto-scaling for read/write capacity
4. Implement TTL for temporary files if needed

**Testing**:
- Verify table creation using AWS CLI or console
- Test basic CRUD operations on the table
- Validate GSI functionality with query operations
- Perform load testing to ensure capacity settings are appropriate

### Step 3: Update Lambda Functions
**Objective**: Create Lambda functions to handle file operations.

**Implementation**:
1. Create new Lambda functions for:
   - File upload (with presigned URL generation)
   - File download (with presigned URL generation)
   - File listing (query DynamoDB by user)
   - File deletion (remove from S3 and DynamoDB)
   - File update (update content and metadata)
2. Configure appropriate permissions via IAM roles
3. Implement error handling and logging
4. Add authentication checks using Cognito

**Testing**:
- Unit test each Lambda function independently
- Test with various file sizes and types
- Verify error handling for edge cases
- Validate authentication and authorization
- Perform integration tests with S3 and DynamoDB

### Step 4: Configure API Gateway Endpoints
**Objective**: Create API endpoints for file operations and integrate with CloudFront.

**Implementation**:
1. Add new routes to API Gateway:
   - POST /files (upload)
   - GET /files (list)
   - GET /files/{id} (download)
   - PUT /files/{id} (update)
   - DELETE /files/{id} (delete)
2. Configure Cognito authorizers for all endpoints
3. Set up request/response mappings
4. Update CloudFront distribution to forward these new paths
5. Configure proper CORS headers for browser requests

**Testing**:
- Test each endpoint with valid requests
- Verify authorization is working correctly
- Test with invalid requests to ensure proper error responses
- Validate CORS headers in responses
- Confirm CloudFront is correctly forwarding requests

## Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

- Verify drag-and-drop functionality works in different browsers
- Test upload progress indicator
- Validate error handling for oversized files
- Test upload cancellation
- Verify integration with backend API

### Step 6: Implement File List Component
**Objective**: Create a UI for listing and searching uploaded files.

**Implementation**:
1. Build a file listing component with sorting options
2. Implement search functionality by filename
3. Add filtering by upload date
4. Create pagination for large lists
5. Show relevant metadata (name, size, date)
6. Add refresh functionality
7. Connect to list API endpoint

**Testing**:
- Test rendering with various list sizes
- Verify sorting functionality (by name, date, size)
- Validate search and filter capabilities
- Test pagination with large datasets
- Confirm metadata is displayed correctly
- Verify integration with backend API

### Step 7: Develop File Actions
**Objective**: Implement file operations (download, delete, preview).

**Implementation**:
1. Add download functionality
2. Implement file deletion with confirmation
3. Create text file preview component
4. Add loading states for all operations
5. Implement error handling
6. Connect to respective API endpoints

**Testing**:
- Test file download functionality
- Verify deletion works and updates the file list
- Test file preview with different text file formats
- Validate error handling for each operation
- Test with slow network conditions

## Technical Considerations
1. File size limits should be enforced (both frontend and backend)
2. Consider using presigned URLs for direct S3 access
3. Implement appropriate error handling for all operations
4. Ensure proper authentication/authorization throughout
5. Consider cost optimization for S3 and DynamoDB usage
6. Maintain HIPAA compliance for sensitive data
7. Implement proper logging and monitoring
8. Consider multi-region deployment for global access

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to extending the application with a complete file management system while leveraging the existing authentication and infrastructure.
