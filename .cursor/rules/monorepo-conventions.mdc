# Monorepo Conventions

## Global Standards
- Use absolute paths when possible in tool calls
- Follow the established folder structure
- Each major component (backend, frontend, infrastructure) has its own build/test scripts
- Documentation goes in docs/ folder
- Design decisions should be documented in docs/

## Project Structure
- backend/ - Python backend with Lambda functions
- frontend/ - React/TypeScript frontend
- infrastructure/ - Terraform infrastructure code
- docs/ - All design and API documentation
- scripts/ - Build, test, and utility scripts

## Development Workflow
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Update documentation when making architectural changes
- Use component-specific build scripts
- Follow component-specific conventions (see other rules)

## Code Change Standards
- NEVER edit code without explaining why you have chosen that approach
- Always provide evidence for your diagnosis before implementing solutions
- Prefer solutions where you have concrete evidence of the root cause
- Document your reasoning: what you found, why this fix addresses it, what evidence supports this approach
- Avoid speculative fixes - investigate and gather evidence first
