# FZIP Operations Conventions

## Implementation Standards
- Follow FZIP backup/restore design patterns
- Use proper state management for long-running operations
- Implement proper error handling and rollback
- Reference docs/fzip-*.md for implementation details

## State Management
- Track job progress through well-defined states
- Implement proper cancellation mechanisms
- Handle timeouts and retries appropriately
- Provide clear status updates to users

## Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error recovery
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Implement proper rollback procedures

## Documentation References
- docs/fzip-backup-restore-guide.md - General guide
- docs/fzip-restore-flow.md - Restore flow specifics
- docs/fzip-restore-simplified-implementation.md - Implementation details

## Testing
- Test backup and restore roundtrip scenarios
- Test cancellation at various stages
- Test error conditions and recovery
- Validate data integrity throughout process

## File Naming
- Use consistent *fzip* naming patterns
- Separate backup and restore operations clearly
- Follow established service/handler patterns
