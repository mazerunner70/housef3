# New Frontend Convention Documents Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the new convention documents created to complete the frontend architecture documentation.

## Documents Created

### 1. ✅ frontend-domain-conventions.mdc (COMPLETED)

**Purpose:** Consolidates all domain organization patterns

**Key Content:**
- What is a domain and when to create one
- Standard domain folder structure
- `{DomainName}Page.tsx` pattern and template
- Code colocation rules within domains
- Progressive promotion pattern (domain → shared)
- Domain organization patterns (small/medium/large)
- Examples from your codebase (transfers)

2. **frontend-domain-conventions.mdc** - Understanding domain organization
3. **frontend-component-conventions.mdc** - Building components

## Quick Reference Guide

### For New Features:

**Step 1: Determine Type**
- Single feature with own route? → Create domain (domain-conventions.mdc)
- Reusable component? → Component conventions (component-conventions.mdc)
- State logic? → Hook conventions (hook-conventions.mdc)

**Step 2: Follow Structure**
```
New Feature "Analytics"
  ↓
1. Create domain folder (frontend-domain-conventions.mdc)
   components/domain/analytics/
  ↓
2. Create entry point (frontend-domain-conventions.mdc)
   AnalyticsPage.tsx
  ↓
3. Create main component (frontend-component-conventions.mdc)
   AnalyticsDashboard.tsx
  ↓
4. Add hooks as needed (frontend-hook-conventions.mdc)
   hooks/useAnalyticsData.ts
  ↓
5. Add services if needed (frontend-services-conventions.mdc)
   services/analyticsApi.ts
```

**Step 3: Follow Code Colocation**
- Start everything in domain folder
- Extract to shared when used by 3+ features
- Document in appropriate conventions

### For Refactoring:

**Extract Reusable Logic:**
1. Component reused 3+ times? → Move to `components/business/` (component-conventions.mdc)
2. Hook reused 3+ times? → Move to `src/hooks/` (hook-conventions.mdc)
3. Service reused 3+ times? → Already in `src/services/` (services-conventions.mdc)

**Organize Complex View:**
1. Break into layers (view-conventions.mdc)
2. Extract custom hooks (hook-conventions.mdc)
3. Separate components (component-conventions.mdc)

## What's Not Covered (Intentionally)

These topics are intentionally integrated into existing documents rather than separate docs:

### Testing
- **Why integrated:** Testing is covered in relevant documents:
  - Component testing → component-conventions.mdc
  - Hook testing → hook-conventions.mdc
  - Service testing → services-conventions.mdc

- **Benefit:** Testing guidance is contextual and immediately applicable

### Routing
- **Why integrated:** Routing is covered in:
  - Domain routing → frontend-domain-conventions.mdc
  - Page routing → frontend-conventions.mdc
  - Deep linking → DEEP_LINKING_ARCHITECTURE.md

- **Benefit:** Routing is understood in context of architecture

### Styling
- **Why integrated:** Styling is covered in:
  - Component styling → component-conventions.mdc
  - Global styles → frontend-conventions.mdc
  - Theme system → Mentioned in conventions

- **Benefit:** Styling patterns are with components that use them
