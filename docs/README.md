## üìù Documentation Standards

When adding new documentation:
1. Place in the appropriate subfolder based on scope (architecture/features/ui/api)
2. For feature docs, create a new subfolder under `features/` if it's a distinct domain
3. Use descriptive filenames with hyphens (e.g., `feature-name-design.md`)
4. Update this README with links to new documents
5. Include design rationale, technical specifications, and implementation details
