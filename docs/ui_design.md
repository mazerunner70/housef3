# UI Design: Modern Finance App

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the UI design for a modern finance application. The goal is to create an intuitive, visually appealing, and flexible interface that supports core financial management tasks and can be extended for future features.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Clarity:** Information should be presented in a clear, concise, and easily understandable manner.
*   **Efficiency:** Users should be able to complete common tasks quickly and with minimal effort.
*   **Insightful:** The UI should help users understand their financial situation through visualizations and summaries.
*   **Modern Aesthetic:** A clean, contemporary look and feel.
*   **Responsive:** The design should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to accessibility best practices (WCAG AA as a target).

## 3. Top-Level Navigation & Layout

A persistent sidebar navigation combined with a dynamic main content area is proposed.

### 3.1. Sidebar Navigation

*   **Logo/App Name:** At the top.
*   **Navigation Links (Icons + Text):**
    *   **Dashboard/Overview:** (Default View) High-level summary of finances.
    *   **Transactions:** For managing and categorizing transactions. Includes sub-sections for:

        *   File Management (Import/Export statements)
    *   **Accounts:** Manage bank accounts, credit cards, investments, etc.
    *   **Analytics/Reports:** Visualizations of spending, income, net worth.
    *   **Budgets:** (Future) For creating and tracking budgets.

    *   **Settings:** User profile, application preferences, security.
*   **User Profile/Logout:** At the bottom.

### 3.2. Main Content Area

This area will dynamically display the content based on the selected navigation item. It will typically consist of:
*   **Header:** Title of the current section, and contextual actions (e.g., "Add New Account", "Import Statement").
